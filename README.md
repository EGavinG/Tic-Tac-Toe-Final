# Tic Tac Toe Final

Aliens have decided to finally invade Earth! Took them long enough its 2023...

We must defend the planet from their invasion in a battle across the galaxy.
Guess how we will be doing that?

# A GAME OF TIC TAC TOE!

This project allows two players to sit together and play out a game of Tic Tac Toe. Since Aliens are attacking earth Aliens will always go first so first move click initiates that. The game will keep score to their respective scoreboard. It will automatically reset the board after 10 wins thus declaring the rightful winner of the world. Header updates showcasing each players turn, winner, and draw. I've included a reset score button to those who are only wanting to play shorter games as well as color change button to change the color style for fun preference.

## Skills and Technology

My goals were to hone my skills at:

- Semantic HTML with alt attributes
- Clean CSS, adding styling classes
- Vanilla Javascript trending toward DRY code, keeping in mind SRP as best as possible
- Utilizing localStorage to hold player data
- Checking for accessibility with no errors/contrast errors [WAVE](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wave-evaluation-tool/jbbplnpkjmmeebjpijfedlgcdilocofh)

## Contributors

The project was crafted and deployed by [Gavin](https://github.com/EGavinG).

## Functionality

This is how the site works.

You can:

1. Win
2. Draw
3. Can't click on a square if there's already an :alien: or :rocket: on it:
4. Header showcases who's next, who wins, and when there is a draw
5. When a player wins, their wins are displayed on the side panels respectively
6. If desired, I've supplied a reset score button and color change button

## Support and Future Plans

Would like to build more into this project once I learn animation and soundfx to supply to this project in a later date.
